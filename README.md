### Link to site: [Sunflower Express](https://jenharden.github.io/Train-Schedule/)

## Objective:
```
To create a train schedule that incorporates Firebase to host data.
```
### Description:
```
This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host train data.  The application gives the user the ability to add another train to the schedule.
It will then display the schedule in a repeating table that will provide the train information, including the next arrival time (based on current time) and calculate 
the minutes left before the next train arrives.  The application is able to do these additional calculations by utilizing Moment.js. This information is stored in 
Firebase, for data persistence, and is retrieved every time the schedule page is loaded.
